# Policy_Making_-_Decision
Like molecular genetic technologies like DNA finger printing revolutionized forensic science, A.I. based models & technologies are influening 
policy making of businesses and governments. A.I. based facial-recognition is one good example to highlight the role of machine learning and deeplearning
models in policy making. Western European governments and courts have started using facial recognition technologies to identify suspects and pronounce 
justice. Businesses and public sector entities generate a huge amount of data on daily basis which remain mostly unleveraged. As an engineer and with 
desires to become an entrepreneur, I see a great opportunity to equip myself with policy and decision-making tools that may help us to make not just
better decisions but decisions for better and collective growth. With this pre-set mind, I am digging into analyzing successful A.I. models and
trying to understand frameworks for developing such models.
